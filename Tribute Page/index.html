              1st Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire an Indian
              Maratha-warrior-king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
              Shivaji Bhosale (Marathi pronunciation April 3, 1680 was an Indian
              warrior-king and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji
              carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of
              Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he
              was formally crowned as the chhatrapati (emperor) of his realm at
              Raigad. Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both
              alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, Sultanate of
              Golkonda and Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as European colonial
              powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of
              influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha
              navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule
              with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived
              ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and
              promoted the usage of Marathi and Sanskrit, rather than Persian
              language, in court and administration.
